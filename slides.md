# overthinking window management for fun and profit

## getting focussed

strategies for cycling through windows:

- cycle through windows in an arbitrary order (terrible idea)

- cycle through windows in most recently used order

more direct strategies:

- cardinal focus

- you could also use the mouse I guess...

## floating or tiling?

floating:

- manual window placement

- each window exists independently of all the others, overlapping / stacking

- flexibility and least surprise is king

tiling:

- arrange windows in a grid

- efficent use of screenspace and keypresses

- potentially less flexible, learning curve
