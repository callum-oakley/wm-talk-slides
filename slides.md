# Overthinking window management for fun &amp; profit

## Getting focussed

Strategies for cycling through windows

- Cycle through windows in an arbitrary order (terrible idea)

- Cycle through windows in most recently used order

More direct strategies

- Cardinal focus

- You could also use the mouse I guess&hellip;

---

## Floating or tiling?

Floating

- Manual window placement

- Each window exists independently of all the others, overlapping / stacking

- Flexibility and least surprise

Tiling

- Automatically arrange windows in a grid

- Efficent use of screenspace and keypresses

- Potentially less flexible, learning curve

## Getting organised

- The desktop metaphor

- Partitioning windows in to small related sets (desktops)

- Apply the same strategies described for focus to change the active desktop

---

## Stretching the desktop metaphor

Groups

- a window belongs to exactly one group

- any number of groups can be visible at once

Tags

- a window belongs to any number of tags

- any number of tags can be visible at once

---

## Views

- a window belongs to at least one view

- precisely one view is visible at once

- position and location of windows in different views are independent

---

## In defense of &ldquo;wasted space&rdquo;

- Helps with focus

- Prevents borders from getting lost in the noise
